# StoryCAD for Learners

## Learning by Doing

StoryCAD is first and foremost a tool and workbench for working fiction writers, to help you
create an effective outline for your story. But StoryCAD also helps budding writers. Instead of trudging through traditional learning curves (books and courses),  you'll learn through doing as you craft your story. Our proven workflow and rich workbench can help you learn to explore a story idea, shape characters, discover your story's conflicts, construct a plot, and create your narrative. 

This approach offers a twofold benefit: not only do you gain practical experience with the software, but also a profound understanding of the writing process itself. By allowing immediate implementation of new skills. With StoryCAD, every stroke of the keyboard enhances your journey as a storyteller. It's not the only way to learn: there are great books and courses, and we hope you continue to grow throughout your writing career. But learning by doing is effective, engaging, and above all, practical.

## The Importance of Workflow

[tk What follows is is an article on workflow. That's not what I want here. Move this into the manual, say, and link to it here.]

Workflow is the process of sequence of steps necessary to perform a job or produce a product. If your product is a short story, novel, screenplay or stage play, the sequence of steps will probably look something like this: idea generation, research, outlining, draft writing, revision, editing, gathering feedback, submission, and publication/production.

As an outliner, StoryCAD isn't going to be of much help after outlining (although [tk reference critiquing via outlining (reference Other Uses for StoryCAD)]).  That said, the first three steps (idea generation, research, and outlining) are why StoryCAD exist. 

Before going into details, here's why having a workflow is important: it's the secret sauce of working writers. Workflow informs the work and tells you what the next step is. It's what keeps you moving forward and what will ultimately give you your finished story.

Every story starts with an idea. A story idea might spring into your mind fully formed and read to move to next steps, but ideas can also be mere fragments: something seen or read which sparks your curiosity, a person you know or are aware of, a place: anything that made you think 'there's a story there.' A fragmentary idea is just that, however. It's not something you can begin plotting, unless you're a glutton for punishment [tk better phrase]. To flesh out the idea, StoryCAD helps you move from idea to concept to premise. [tk explain these in brief detail.]

[tk too wordy] A story idea or premise often need gestation before it can be developed further.  That's often a signal of a lack of knowledge of the story's subject, world, and characters. To be fair,  some or all of these will likely be just glimmers at this stage. Even if you may know some parts quite well: you're a police detective writing a crime novel, for example, every story will likely have pieces where there's a gap of knowledge.

But if you know your story premise intimately, you may have a sense that the story isn't specific or unique enough to carry you forward. That's a good thing. A novel might represent  80,000 words of writing; a play may take years of work to get to the stage. You need to be confident your premise is worth the  effort is worth the effort to develop it.

The fix for both of these problems is research. The maxim 'write what you  know' is good advice, but you can learn, and know whatever you want to write about. StoryCAD helps with this by providing two story elements, Webpage and Note, which can help you gather and organize information. It also gives you thousands of examples and hints in the form of drop-down lists

## Bibliography

StoryCAD is a software tool for fiction writers, whose purpose is to assist in
creating the outline of a story. Think of a shopping list organized by isle as an
outline of a trip to the grocery store. The outline of your story is similar, but 
instead of bread and onions, the major parts in your story's list are 
'story elements', such as characters, the conflicts that drive the story, your plot 
structure (scenes), and settings.  

Story elements are the building blocks of stories. They're taught in classes and writer's 
workshops, distilled in a story summary or synopsis, and they're what readers 
describe when discuss a story. They're also what you'll ponder, agonize over, 
and dream and have nightmares about. 

Each story element is a tangable object; you can describe it, break it down into smaller 
parts, and analyze it on its own. Is a character lifelike? Does he have agency? Does a
setting contribue to the story's theme, or does it detract? Is your list of scenes 
linked by cause and effect? Does a scene have drama of its own? In StoryCAD,
these story elements are created from templates- forms which organize and assist 
in thinking about that particular aspect of your story. 

Elements are also fungible: they can be readily changed, moved around, or even
thrown out and replaced with something better. 

Once you understand story elements this way, you can think of them as parts in 
your story factory, designing them and fitting them together, or modifying them to 
better fit your design. You can even copy characters and settings from one story to 
another or into shared story worlds. 

StoryCAD operates somewhat like a File Explorer, but instead of a hierarch of files and 
folders, StoryCAD's hierarchy is major story elements, which can be added, deleted,
or rearranged. Each major story element- Problem, Character, Setting, and Scene- 
contain tabs which provide a progression or workflow to develop it. StoryCAD 
lets you focus on each story element separately, which simplifies the outlining process.  

StoryCAD also provides thousands of examples for dozens of smaller story elements, 
in the form of pull-down lists of choices, although you're generally not required to stick
to them. The examples aren't there to limit your imagination, but to encourage it; 
to eliminate writer's block. Together with StoryCAD's extensive documentation, they
provide a short course in fiction writing. We believe that every story idea can be developed into a 
complete outline, ready for you to apply your unique voice and style from first draft
to submission.

## Getting Started With StoryCAD

The best way to learn StoryCAD is to try it (it's free.) It comes with a number of
componts to ease your learning path:

### User Manual

A comprehensive user manual can be found [online][3] and can also be accessed within
StoryCAD from the help button on the menuy bar. 

### Samples

StoryCAD ships with a handful of outlines as StoryCAD projects for you to 
study. If you wish to try your hand at changing one, we suggest copying it to a
work location using the Save As menu function.

### Tutorial

The User Manual contains a chapter which walks through the creation of a story outline
from beginning to end. Create a new, empty outline in StoryCAD and flesh it out 
as the tutorial proceeds. The samples set contains the tutorial (Danger Calls), so you
can compare what you created to what we did.

### Online Help

StoryCAD's menu bar contains a [Help **('?')**][3] button which launches the user manual.

## Contributing

You may not know C# from B-flat, or XAML from Xanadu, but that doesn't mean
that a writer can't contribute to this project. There are many ways you, as a writer,
can [make a contribution toward improving StoryCAD][2].
